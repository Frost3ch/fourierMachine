Welcome to the Fourier Drawing Machine mod. This mod was created for the youtube video: "Drawing with Circles in Minecraft | Fourier Drawing Machines", found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46vdmfv0Q8U&t=31s.

The mod adds a "Conway Block" and "Game Controller" item to the game. It additionally adds the "/resetConwayBlocks" command.

The mod allows the well-known 0 player game to be simulated in Minecraft. I hope you enjoy!

The latest build can be found at /build/libs/fouriermachine-1.0.0.jar

To set-up the mod:
- Download fabric loader for 1.21.1
- Download mod jar file
- Download fabric api jar file for 1.21.1
- Launch fabric and enjoy!
  
MOD DETAILS:
- /fourier <item> <x> <y> <z> <iCount> <size> <speed>
e.g. /fourier "dog" 0 0 0 1 1 1
This creates a fourier drawing with the pivot of the first arm at the speciifed (x,y,z) point.

- /pi <x> <y> <z> <size> <speed>
e.g. /pi 0 0 0 1 1
This creates a visualization of the irrationality of pi with the pivot of the first arm at the speciifed (x,y,z) point.

/resetFourier
This stops all current drawings.

/blocks
Toggles the arms drawing blocks at the end on top of the particles.

/fourierArmSize <multiplier>
Changes size of the drawing arms.

/particleSize <multiplier>
Changes size of drawing particles.

/freeze
Freezes arms in place.
